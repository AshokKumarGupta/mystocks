	<p>Hello, I am Ashok Gupta, a client side developer with over 8+ years of experience in development of modern web/mobile apps. I always enjoy learning new technologies which has created an impact in market. I like to develop apps to avoid challenges which I faced at-least once in past hence idea of mystocks was born. </p>
	
	<p>I always felt that it was difficult to list all my favourite Indian stocks in one screen without any additional authentication. Also, keep a note for each stock as needed which works as an input anytime when we need to buy/sell it.</p> 

	

  <p>I hope you enjoy using it. Please do write review and also rate this app.</p>

  <p>This app is developed using Ionic 2 framework.</p>
